</p>

After inserting that key, translations between 10 languages are currently possible (German, English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch, Polish, Russian, Japanese, Chinese). A source language, a target language and the text to be translated need to be specified:

Finally, the translations from one session can be exported to a .txt file for later reviews. It is located in the "Documents/Translate Archiver" directory. The entries are grouped by language pairs.
